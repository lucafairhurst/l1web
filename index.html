            <h2>A new evil has overtaken the world as we know. Feminism. The world is now void of all sandwiches and anything masculine. Cars no longer exist, nor does any facial hair exist. You must conform to the feminist views, ideas and activities or you are killed.
Soy boys and feminists are all that exist. So to find out about different creatures on this world, or to find out how to survive, use the above links to take you to safety. And remember to bookmark this page and to never let it be known to the creatures that inhabit this world. Even if you were to tell the feminists about this, they would never be able to see this text because blue is invisible to them. </h2>
